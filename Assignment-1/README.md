# Assignment 1

This is a [link](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4cXfW2), but, it seems like I've missed 
the point? Are we talking about a specific use of webGL like one shader from shadertoy,
or like, an entire website like all of shadertoy? Anyways, I really like the simplicity
of this shader. It just uses white quadrilaterals on a black background and changes thier
skew and size. Nice and simple, mesmerizing effect.
