# Project Overview
I intend to create a simple game using the keyboard's cursor to steer a spaceship down an infinite hallway. I'll use models that I can find on the Internet, and will use a perspective that seats the camera behind the ship and points down the tunnel. Randomly placed obstacles will need to be avoided, some of which might cast light if I have time for that. Obstacles will have one of about two textured models.

# Project Schedule
**Week 1**
Get the ship to follow the cursor

**Week 2**
Get obstacles to spawn in and end the game when they get too cloe.

# Project Technical Requirements
I'm aiming to use Three JS and Javascript to accomplish this.
